Application Server vs Web Server

In this project, we will design a scalable web infrastructure using one server, one load balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster, and split components (web server, application server, and database) with their own dedicated servers.

Components:

Server 1:

Role: Web Server (Nginx)
Purpose: To handle HTTP requests from users, serve static files, and handle reverse proxying to the application server.
Server 2:

Role: Application Server
Purpose: To execute the server-side code, process dynamic content, and generate responses for the website.
Server 3:

Role: Database (MySQL)
Purpose: To store and manage the website's data.
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Purpose: To distribute incoming HTTP requests across the two application servers (Server 1 and Server 2) in a balanced manner. The HAProxy load balancer is configured as a cluster for high availability.
Explanation:

Web Server (Nginx):

We add a web server (Nginx) to handle HTTP requests from users and serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nginx also performs reverse proxying to the application server for handling dynamic content.
Application Server:

The application server is responsible for executing the server-side code, processing dynamic content, and generating responses for the website. It interacts with the web server for static content and communicates with the database for data retrieval and storage.
Database (MySQL):

We have a dedicated database server (MySQL) to store and manage the website's data. Separating the database from the application and web servers ensures better resource utilization and improves scalability.
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

We use the HAProxy load balancer to distribute incoming HTTP requests across the two application servers (Server 1 and Server 2). Configuring HAProxy as a cluster ensures high availability, as if one load balancer fails, the other can continue handling requests seamlessly.
Why Splitting Components:
Splitting the components (web server, application server, and database) with their own dedicated servers allows for better resource management, scalability, and fault tolerance. By separating the concerns, we can scale each component independently based on its specific resource requirements.

Why HAProxy Load Balancer:
HAProxy is a reliable and high-performance load balancer that helps distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple application servers. Configuring HAProxy as a cluster ensures that even if one load balancer goes down, the other one can take over to ensure continuous service availability.

Scaling Up:
To scale up this infrastructure, we can add more application servers and database servers as needed. The HAProxy load balancer can be reconfigured to include the new application servers in the cluster, ensuring even distribution of incoming traffic.

Additional Notes:

Ensure proper security measures are implemented, such as firewalls and SSL certificates, to protect the infrastructure and data.
Monitor the servers and infrastructure components to detect potential issues and optimize performance.
Regularly back up the database to avoid data loss in case of failures or accidents.
