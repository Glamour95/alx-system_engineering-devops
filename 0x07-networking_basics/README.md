## OSI model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract model that describes layered communication and computer network design. It provides a framework to understand the different parts involved in communication. The OSI model consists of seven layers, ranging from the physical transmission layer to the application layer.

In this project, we focus on the Transport and Network layers, specifically TCP/UDP, IP, and ICMP protocols.

To learn more about the OSI model and its organization, please refer to [File 0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model).

## Types of network

This section covers different types of networks, such as LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet. It explores how these networks are interconnected and their role in connecting devices.

To test your knowledge about types of networks, refer to [File 1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network).

## MAC and IP address

Understanding MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses is crucial in networking. MAC addresses uniquely identify network interfaces, while IP addresses identify devices on a network.

To learn more about MAC and IP addresses, refer to [File 2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address).

## UDP and TCP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are transport layer protocols that facilitate the exchange of data between devices over IP networks. Each protocol has its characteristics and use cases.

To fill in the missing parts and understand more about UDP and TCP, refer to [File 3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP).

## TCP and UDP ports

Ports play a crucial role in networking, enabling communication between network devices. This section focuses on TCP and UDP ports, their purpose, and commonly used ports.

To view a Bash script that displays listening ports, refer to [File 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports).

## Is the host on the network

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to check the availability of network devices. The `ping` command utilizes ICMP to verify if a network device is online or troubleshoot network issues.

To implement a Bash script that pings an IP address, refer to [File 5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network).
