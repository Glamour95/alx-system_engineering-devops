# OSI Model

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model that describes layered communication and computer network design. The OSI model segregates the different parts involved in communication and provides a conceptual framework to understand complex interactions in networking.

## Organization of the OSI Model

The OSI model is organized from the lowest level to the highest level, consisting of the following layers:

1. Layer 1: Physical Layer
2. Layer 2: Data Link Layer
3. Layer 3: Network Layer
4. Layer 4: Transport Layer
5. Layer 5: Session Layer
6. Layer 6: Presentation Layer
7. Layer 7: Application Layer

The lowest level, Layer 1, deals with the physical transmission of data using electrical impulses, light, or radio signals. The highest level, Layer 7, is responsible for application-specific communication such as SNMP for emails or HTTP for web browser.
